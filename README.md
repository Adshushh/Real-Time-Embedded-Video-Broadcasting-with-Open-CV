# Real-Time-Embedded-Video-Broadcasting-with-Open-CV
This project features a live video streaming setup using a Raspberry Pi and Pi Camera, programmed with Python and enhanced using OpenCV for real-time image handling. Development and control were performed remotely via SSH, enabling seamless coding and deployment from a laptop over the same network using dynamic IP addressing.
